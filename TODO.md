# TODO

The main interface for the app will consist of:
- A single page centered horizontally and vertically
- A place for users to drag/upload xlsx files or csv files
- User clicks convert to start the conversion
- Loading bar?
- User clicks download

There will also be a options tab for changing:
- Changing specific dates where the schedule is the same as a different day
- Whether to include professor name in the notes or the right location.

This could be a series of DatePickers and checkboxes as well instead of a CodeMirror editor.
